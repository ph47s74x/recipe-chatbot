description: Ensure every top-level module in `src/` has a corresponding documentation file in `docs/`.
globs: src/**/index.js
---

- For every `src/<module>/index.js`, there **must** be a corresponding file at: 

docs/<module>.md

or

docs/<domain>/<module>.md


- Acceptable docs subfolders: `docs/standards/`, `docs/architecture/`, or domain-specific folders.

- The documentation file **must**:
- Include the same module name in the filename.
- Cover the exported functions, classes, constants, or middleware described in the corresponding code.
- Follow the [Documentation Standards](docs/standards/documentation.md) format.

- If the `index.js` is a barrel file (re-export only), documentation may live under the submodules, but a stub doc must still exist with references.

- CI and pre-commit checks must validate parity using a filesystem scan.
